## Short Bio

I am an Assistant Professor (2023-) in the College of Computer Science and the Institute of Advanced Technology at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). Prior to that, I got the bachelor of engineering degree (2014-2018) from the [CS department of Zhejiang University](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/), working with [Prof. Hui Qian](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n4csXw0AAAAJ&hl=en). I obtained my Ph.D degree (2018-2023) from [DCD Lab@Zhejiang University](http://www.cs.zju.edu.cn/_upload/article/files/d4/45/e46a2ca6469693738d84d1fffc3f/cc70a9ee-44ce-4603-9e46-701564a0eb2a.pdf), under the supervision of [Prof. Xi Li](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=TYNPJQMAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interests include machine learning and computer vision, currently focusing on continual learning, machine unlearning, and generative models.

I am actively seeking highly motivated Ph.D/Master candidates who share my research interests. Kindly reach out to me at zhaohanbin@zju.edu.cn with your resume!
